# gtk3-opengl

[![Build](https://github.com/aklomp/gtk3-opengl/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aklomp/gtk3-opengl/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A small test program to figure out how best to combine GTK+ 3's `GtkGLArea`,
GDK 3's `GdkFrameClock`, and modern OpenGL. Will open a small window with a
rotating, shaded cube that you can interact with with the mouse.
